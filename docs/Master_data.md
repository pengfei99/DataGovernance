# Master Data

Master data is the core, **non-transactional data** used across your enterprise, including customers, products, 
supplier locations and chart of accounts.

Let’s start with an example. If you look at a standard table of data — say, from your ERP, for example — you can see 
the transactional data like the order date, number, quantity and sub-total. These values are typically unique and 
accumulate quickly — your retail store may process thousands of order per day, for example.

But you’ll also see data that are constant across your organization. For example, the currency code (e.g USD, RMB), 
the product unit price, the custom id, etc. Master data can be any type of data as long as an organization agrees 
to a single definition.

**Master data is an important class of data as it represents an opportunity to manage and govern data as a single source of reference.**

## Master Data Management 

What is Master Data Management
Master data management (MDM) is a method of linking all the important and critical data to a common point of reference, 
improving the quality of the data to a great extent. Moreover, it is possible to apply it to any computing architecture, 
platform or application. Usually, master data management is useful for large enterprises than small to medium scale organizations.

An organization has multiple departments; it is useful to link them all to a single reference point rather than keeping 
the data in separate departments. It improves consistent use and reuse of data. However, merging of data can be 
challenging as different departments use different tools and technologies. There can also be issues such as 
data duplication, incomplete data and data with errors. Therefore, as an alternative to this issue, master 
data managers use a reliable data dictionary across multiple systems. Furthermore, it is also necessary to 
update the master data.

# Metadata management

What is Metadata Management ?

Metadata management is the process of handling data that describes other data. Also, it involves tasks such as 
establishing policies, processes to ensure data integration, accessing, sharing, linking, analyzing and maintaining. 
Generally, metadata can be generated when creating, acquiring, adding, deleting or updating data. For example, assume 
Microsoft Word application. It provides documents metadata such as file size, date of creating the document and data 
of modifications.

Metadata management helps to find a particular data asset. It includes creating a metadata repository, adding data to 
that repository and using that data. Moreover, it minimizes the redundancy of effort and improves data consistency. 
Also, this allows using data as required. Furthermore, it is not compulsory to maintain the information under one 
specific employee.


# Master data vs metadata

The main difference between master data management and metadata management is that **master data management is the process of linking all the critical data into a common reference point while metadata management is the process of administrating the data that describes other data**.
