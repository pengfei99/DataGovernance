# Introduction of RDF and DCAT

**RDF (Resource Description Framework)** and **DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary)** are foundational components of the 
`semantic web and linked data ecosystems`. Both are standards developed by the `W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)` to 
support structured `data sharing` across domains and systems.


## **DCAT is built on RDF**

**DCAT is an RDF vocabulary** specifically designed for describing datasets and data catalogs. `RDF provides the 
data model and syntax`, while `DCAT defines a semantic schema (ontology) within that model` for a very specific 
purpose:
- describing datasets
- describing metadata of datasets
- how to access datasets.
